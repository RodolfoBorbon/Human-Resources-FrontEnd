      <!-- Departments Page Summary -->
      <div class="card mb-4">
        <div class="card-header bg-primary text-white">Departments Page</div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            The Departments Page is central to the administration of department
            records within an organization. The page starts with a "Department
            Registration Form" that allows the creation or updating of
            department data, like the department's name, associated manager, and
            location. Users are provided with dropdown selections and input
            fields, with validation ensuring all required data is entered. Below
            the form, a "Search Area" empowers users to locate specific
            department records using criteria like department id or name.
            Lastly, the "Department Dashboard" section displays all departments
            in a structured table format, where each entry is accompanied by
            options to update or delete that specific record.

      <!-- Employees Page Summary -->
      <div class="card mb-4">
        <div class="card-header bg-secondary text-white">Employees Page</div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            The Employees Page is dedicated to managing individual employee
            records within the organization. At the top, there's likely an
            "Employee Registration Form" that captures essential details such as
            employee name, designation, department, and contact information.
            Mandatory fields are probably highlighted, ensuring all crucial data
            is entered before submission. A subsequent "Search Area" would
            permit users to pinpoint specific employees using relevant criteria
            like employee ID, name, or department. The main body would showcase
            an "Employee Dashboard", a table listing all employees, where each
            record is possibly accompanied by options to update, view details,
            or delete the employee entry.

      <!-- Jobs Page Summary -->
      <div class="card mb-4">
        <div class="card-header bg-success text-white">Jobs Page</div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            The Jobs Page is tailored for job role management within the
            organization. It probably commences with a "Job Registration Form"
            that lets administrators define or revise job titles, descriptions,
            minimum and maximum salary scales, and other pertinent job
            attributes. Required fields would be emphasized to maintain data
            integrity. An intermediary "Search Area" facilitates users in
            locating specific job roles using appropriate search terms, such as
            job title or description. The primary section, the "Job Dashboard",
            would present all job roles in a detailed table. Each listed job
            role might be paired with options to modify, delve deeper, or
            eradicate the specific job entry.

      <!-- User Authentication Summary -->
      <div class="card mb-4">
        <div class="card-header bg-info text-white">User Authentication</div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            The User Authentication module offers secure management of user
            credentials. Leveraging bcrypt, passwords are hashed before storage,
            ensuring their confidentiality. On registration, the module checks
            for unique usernames or emails, and upon a constraint violation,
            provides a user-friendly message. During login, the module validates
            user credentials by comparing the provided password with the stored
            hashed version. Successful matches lead to a successful login
            response, while mismatches trigger an error message. Lastly, the
            module supports logout functionality to securely end user sessions.
